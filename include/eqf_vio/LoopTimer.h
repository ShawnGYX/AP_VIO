/** @brief A class for timing the processing speed of code sections in a loop.
 *
 * This class is intended to be instantiated as a global loop timer variable. It is set up with some initial timing
 * category labels. Each loop should be denoted with a call to startLoop. Then, the user can call startTiming and
 * endTiming with any of the category labels to start and stop a timer for a given section of code. At the end of each
 * loop, the total time spent on each category of code can be obtained from getLoopTimingData.
